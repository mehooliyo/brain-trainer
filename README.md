## Overview

The user must answer as many math expressions before the countdown timer reaches 0.
The math expression is generated randomly and so are the solutions, except for the real answer.
When the timer reaches 0 the user can replay the game from the beginning.

**TODOs**

 * Show a history of attempts on the bottom, and whether the answer was correct or not
 * Add difficulty settings - different starting times or faster clock
 * Add subtract/multiply/divide/modulus expressions
 * Add animation - e.g. 3, 2, 1, G0!
 * More games!
